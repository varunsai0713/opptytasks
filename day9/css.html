    <!--<p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML. CSS defines how elements should be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media. It allows you to control the layout, colors, fonts, and overall visual appearance of web pages.</p>
    <h2>Key Features of CSS:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Separation of Content and Presentation:</strong> CSS allows you to separate the content of a web page (HTML) from its presentation (CSS). This separation makes it easier to maintain and update the design of a website without affecting its structure.</li>
        <li><strong>Selectors and Properties:</strong> CSS uses selectors to target HTML elements and apply specific styles to them. Properties define the visual characteristics, such as color, font size, margin, padding, etc.</li>
        <li><strong>Cascading and Inheritance:</strong> CSS follows a cascading order, meaning that styles can be applied from multiple sources (inline styles, internal stylesheets, external stylesheets) and the most specific rule takes precedence. Additionally, some properties can be inherited from parent elements to child elements.</li>
        <li><strong>Box Model:</strong> CSS uses the box model to represent the layout of elements. Each element is treated as a rectangular box consisting of content, padding, border, and margin. Understanding the box model is crucial for controlling spacing and alignment.</li>
        <li><strong>Responsive Design:</strong> CSS provides techniques like media queries that allow you to create responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes and devices, enhancing user experience across various platforms.</li>
